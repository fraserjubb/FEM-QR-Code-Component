## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

It felt good finally creating something that was _not_ from a tutorial.

In this particular project:

1. I wanted to add the focus/challenge of using CSS variables as I had never used them before up until this point. Even though they are a little redundant on a smaller project, this felt like a great opportunity to learn it. I now have a much better understanding of how they work and can see their use on larger projects.

```css
:root {
  /* Colors: */
  --white: #fff;
  --slate-300: #d5e1ef;
  --slate-400: #94a3b8;
  --slate-500: #68778d;
  --slate-900: #1f314f;
  --blue-500: #3685ff;
  --blue-600: #2c7dfa;
  --blue-700: #1d4ed8;
  --blue-900: #1e3a8a;

  /* Font Size: */
  --fs-h2: 2.2rem;
  --fs-p-normal: 1.5rem;
  --fs-p-small: 1.2rem;

  /* Font Weight: */
  --fw-normal: 400;
  --fw-bold: 700;

  /* Line Height: */
  --lh-h2: 1.2;
  --lh-p: 1.4;

  /* Letter Spacing: */
  --ls-small: 0.2px;

  /* Spacing: */
  --space-40: 40px;
  --space-24: 24px;
  --space-16: 16px;
}
```

2. This was my first project that involved using a Figma file for reference. It was a little overwhelming at first but I have managed to grasp the basics of navigation in Figma.

3. In the brief for this project, I learned about the screenshot tool, FireShot. A simple tool that can create screenshots of entire webpages with ease. I might consider getting the Pro version in the future.

4. Finally, this is also my first proper README file and having a proper look at Markdown syntax.

### Continued development

After submitting this project, I wish to develop the following:

1. Figure out a naming convention style that works best for me, particularly for CSS variables.

2. Increase my understanding of Figma, particularly navigation. This will likely come through further practice in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) - After referencing the Figma file, I figured out that the colors were named/created using Tailwind CSS. Finding this then helped me for identifying additional colors to use (mainly in the footer).
- [CSS Variables Tutorial - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZPR_78wCnY) - I am someone who learns better through video tutorials. This is a fantastic and concise video which helped me get straight into making my own variables. I'd recommend this channel to anyone learning Web Development.
